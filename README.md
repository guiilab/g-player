# G­Player: Visualization of spatial­-temporal play data

> Visualization and Data Management for Player Activity in Games

## Overview

A data visualization system for viewing and manipulating multiplayer game data. Software will allow researchers to analyze data sets of user activity to understand actions and trends. The system will provide a visual representation of the recorded spatial­-temporal behavior of all players and allow researchers to query data based on metrics such as trajectories of events, frequency of events, and others.

Created in association with Truong-Huy D. Nguyen, Game Development Researcher at Northeastern University.
